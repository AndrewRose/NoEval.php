NoEval - Copyright 2013 Andrew Rose http://andrewrose.co.uk hello@andrewrose.co.uk

The aim of NoEval is to provide a language and safe environment for executing user defined code.

Currently, this is no more than a proof of concept.  Initially I had put together a simple class to evaluate user
defined mathematical expressions based on the concept of lisp s-expressions.  This worked better than anticipated,
so naturally, I decided to take things to the next level and see if I could add common programming language features
such as variables, functions, loops and flow control.

Please note that I am not a lisp programmer and have very limited knowledge of functional programming outside of
javascript functional abilities.

Advice and constructed criticism more than welcome.
